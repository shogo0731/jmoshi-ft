We sampled a small portion of the dataset as an example for this tutorial. The data in this directory is also licensed under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license, just like the original dataset.

The `audio` directory contains the stereo audio files (`.wav`) and the `text` directory contains the word-level transcripts (`.json`), which are required to be tokenized before training.
